# Insurance Customer Analysis Project

## Overview

Sure Tomorrow Insurance Company aims to leverage machine learning to address several key business objectives. This project evaluates the feasibility of using machine learning to:

* **Task 1:** Identify customers similar to a given customer for targeted marketing efforts.
* **Task 2:** Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit, comparing trained models to a dummy baseline.
* **Task 3:** Forecast the number of insurance benefits a new customer will likely receive using a linear regression model.
* **Task 4:** Protect customer personal data while preserving the model's performance from Task 3 through data masking or obfuscation.

## Project Instructions

1.  **Data Loading:** Load the insurance dataset.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Verify data quality by checking for missing values, outliers, and other potential issues.
3.  **Task Implementation:** Implement solutions for each task and answer the questions outlined in the project template.
4.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the findings and insights gained from the project.
